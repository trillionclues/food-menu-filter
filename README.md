Food menu filter App 🍔

## The Project

> This challenge was part of the project for John Smilga's React course, practicing making API calls and using React hooks to make manipulate and store api data

However, I went ahead to add a bit of additional functionality and practice to the App

- Used MealDB API
- Learned to use Promise.all to make parallel Api calls to different endpoints
- Concatenated and added new property(categories) to the respective API data returned
- Utilised Javascript Methods to manipulate and filter rendered UI data according to this new property
- Also hope to/included a seach filter to locate meals

## Tools/Tech used

Some of the major technologies used include:

- ReactJS
- CSS
- MealDB API
